cidr overview
classless inter domain routing 

CIDR block defines the IP address range of the VPC from the providers hardware.For example, 10.0.0.0/16 provides up to 65,536 IP 
addresses.

/num suffixes to vpc ip determine the division of of bites between the networking and hosting elements of the env 

for example 192.168.1.0/24 gives 24 bits to the networking and 8 to the hosting (32 bits in an ip address) 

this is called subnet masking (or declaring)

we include routing tables aka opentofu files with networking vars 
- this includes subnets which are portioned part of the ipaddress

you can run a container right in a network without an instance (ask gpt)


full example at the limits of the maths here of the ip bit shit
