cidr overview
classless inter domain routing 

CIDR block defines the IP address range of the VPC from the providers hardware.For example, 10.0.0.0/16 provides up to 65,536 IP 
addresses.

/num suffixes to vpc ip determine the division of of bites between the networking and hosting elements of the env 

for example 192.168.1.0/24 gives 24 bits to the networking and 8 to the hosting (32 bits in an ip address) 

this is called subnet masking (or declaring)

we include routing tables aka opentofu files with networking vars 
- this includes subnets which are portioned part of the ipaddress

you can run a container right in a network without an instance (ask gpt)


full example at the limits of the maths here of the ip bit shit 

If the VPC has a CIDR block of 192.168.0.0/16, you can create multiple subnets within this VPC. For instance:
* 192.168.1.0/24: A subnet with 256 addresses (254 usable for hosts, after reserving network and broadcast addresses).
* 192.168.2.0/24: Another subnet within the same VPC, also with 256 addresses.

like how do these relate because of the third ip slot? 
basically if you use a 24 bit versus a 16 you have free domain over only the last octet up to value 255, /16 reserves the thrid octet 
space to go up to 255

* The 192.168.1 part is the network portion (24 bits).
so what is outside of the network portion?
just the final hosting value octet 

* The 0-255 range in 192.168.1.0/24 are the host addresses.
what does this mean like ports?
yea ports are on the host 

In a /24 subnet, the host portion (the last 8 bits) allows for 256 unique addresses, typically allocated as follows:
* 192.168.1.0: Network address (reserved).
* 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254: Usable addresses for hosts (VMs, containers, etc.).
* 192.168.1.255: Broadcast address (reserved).

So what is the relationship between the host portion bits and unique addresses?
* VPC CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
    * Subnets:
        * 10.0.1.0/24 for Admin
        * 10.0.2.0/24 for Development
        * 10.0.3.0/24 for Testing
This provides 254 usable IP addresses per subnet, which is suitable for smaller teams or departments.
* VPC CIDR Block: 10.0.0.0/16
    * Subnets:
        * 10.0.0.0/17 for HR
        * 10.0.128.0/17 for Finance
This provides a large number of IP addresses (32,768 per subnet in the example above) for each division.

then what is the difference between 254 and 255 and what about all the other 253 addresses?
could there be ports on each address?
yes


Assume you have a VPC with CIDR block 192.168.0.0/16, and you declare a subnet 192.168.1.0/24. Here's how it might be used:
1. Network Portion (24 bits): 192.168.1.
    * Used by routing tables to direct traffic within the VPC.
    * Defines the subnet within the VPC.
how? i need a opentofu context of this chat and if you dont know that do terraform and use something even lower level too to really 
explain it to me how this is implemented if thats easier but show the tofu/terraform
observe above 


Host Portion (8 bits): 0-255. 
is this in the fourth slot?
yes

* Assignable to various devices and services within the subnet.
* Example addresses:
    * 192.168.1.10: Web server.
    * 192.168.1.20: Database server.
    * 192.168.1.30: Docker container running a microservice.
    * 192.168.1.40: Load balancer.
so chat can you show me managingin all this again with like terraform with port details and security group stuff in the aws context 
above is example


The /24 subnet mask provides a balance between having enough addresses for hosts and maintaining manageable network sizes.
can you show me what not having enough addresses and an unmagable network size would look like? 
maxxing a /24 subnet mask with needing 300 hosts for some reason


* Subnets: Subdivisions within the VPC, each with its own CIDR block. For example, 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/24 are subnets within the 
10.0.0.0/16 VPC.
what constrains the 3rd slot and how are the suffixes in the subnets and parent vpc related, the /24 and /16?
